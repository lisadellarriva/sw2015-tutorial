					<h1>Welcome to the SW2015 Assignment 4 of student Elisa Dell'Arriva</h1>
					<h3>Hello!</h3>
					<p>This is the cover page for presenting the application and here there are some technical and pratical information about it.</p>
					</br>
					<h3>Credits</h3>
					<p>This application is based on tutorial project provided by teacher Rinke Hoekstra on week 1 of the Semantic Web course offered at VU Amsterdam University on period 1 of 2015.
					The original project can be found at <a href='https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/sw2015-tutorial.git' target='_blank'>https://github.com/RinkeHoekstra/sw2015-tutorial.git</a> .</p>

					<h3>Technical Notes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li type='disc'><p>Our server is running at <code>{{ url_for('first_page', _external=True) }}</code></p></li>
						<li type='disc'><p>Stardog is running at <a href='http://localhost:5820/'>http://localhost:5820</a></p></li>
						<li type='disc'><p>The endpoint for the ontology you wish to explore is set to a database called tutorial on Stardog. This means that to be able to see things working, you have to create such database and then upload the ontology onto it.</p></li>
					</ul>
					</br>
					<h3>About the application</h3>
					<p>The application is about Sandwiches!</p>
					<p>Since the ontology used is quite small and limited in terms of both sandwich types(classification) and instances, one might get the sense that the application lacks on pratical uses. However, it was of great learning value!</p>
					<h5><u>Application's features</u>: </h5>
					<ul>
						<li type='disc'>You can explore the ontology via SPARQL queries</li>
						<li type='disc'>You can enable/disable the reasoner as you wish for the searches</li>
						<li type='disc'>You can add new sandwich to the ontology <i>(note: not running reasoner!)</i></li>
						<li type='disc'>You can see the existing sandwiches filtered by characteristics <i>(note: always running reasoner!)</i></li>
					</ul>
